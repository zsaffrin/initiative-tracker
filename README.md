# Initiative Tracker

Simple initiative tracker app for your gaming needs. I built with D&D5e in mind, but tried to keep it general enough to be useful for basically any game with turn-based encounters.

Uses LocalStorage for data, so no login/authentication, though does not presently sync across devices. Built as a PWA, so you can install on your device without need for an appstore.

Works repsonsively on any display size, but layout is intended for mobile/tablet screens in portrait, so desktop view is a little sparse.

Built with

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (unejected)
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for iconography
- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for style
- [tinycolor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) for color manipulation
- [Google Analytics]() to monitor traffic

Shout-out to Miryks20 for the favicon design. All other icons are by FontAwesome.
